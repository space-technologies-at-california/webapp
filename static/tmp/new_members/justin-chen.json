  "bio": "'When we explore the cosmos, we come to believe and prove that we can solve problems that have never been solved.' Joining STAC, I hope to research technologies that will help the world uncover more about the vast, immeasurable expanse of space - to discover solutions to problems that the world has never encountered before.
