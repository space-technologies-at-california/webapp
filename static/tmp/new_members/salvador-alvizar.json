  "bio": "Space is by no means intuitive. If you could be in space without a suit, you wouldn't hear a sound. You could go 10 km/s without feeling a thing. To work on a space project is to think beyond the norm, to solve problems in ridiculous, beautiful ways, even when the odds are terribly stacked against you. This is what I love about space."
