  "bio": "As the age old cliche goes: looking at the stars late at night always gives a sense of insignificance for ourselves and the problems of this world, but like Matthew McConaughey, it may just be that the answers to the problems of this world lie in the stars. I am so incredibly blessed and grateful to be part of this ongoing space revolution, and the challenges and beauty of engineering in space excites me to no end."
