  "bio": "The need to discover and learn about what lies beyond our world drives so much ingenious innovation and the goal of making space habitable still hasn't been fully realized. There's a great deal more to be done, and I'm excited to see and work on the new technologies that will help make space exploration and research more accessible to all!"
