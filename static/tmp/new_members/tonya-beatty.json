  "bio": "Space is an elusive melting pot of knowledge that has fascinated humans for centuries. However, we are at an exciting place far past the point of fascination and at the cusp of exploration where we are discovering things we could not have even imagined 50 years ago. We have to continue pursuing space because we have so much to learn from our universe."
