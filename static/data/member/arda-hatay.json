    "bio": "My interest in space developed as a child while observing stars at night. I kept wondering what could be out there and why we know so little about it. From that day on I imagined myself going to space as an astronaut every day. How cool it would be to be able to spend a portion of my life in space. Today I work towards that goal by aiming to advance space exploration projects."
