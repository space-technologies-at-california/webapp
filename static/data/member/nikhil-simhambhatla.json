    "bio": "Space is the great unknown that provides the surrounding context for our reality. By taking on the challenge of exploring its vastness, not only are we developing our scientific and technologic capabilities, but we are learning more about our own personal existence. Thus, space exploration takes the form of human exploration, pushing the boundaries of mankindâ€™s skills, beliefs, and potential."
