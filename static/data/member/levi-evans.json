  "bio": "In all of my mathematics, physics, and engineering courses, there have always been certain conditions that we were told to take as given or constant such as gravity or the behavior of molecules; however, space as an environment for both thought experiments and engineering completely blows the top off of that system, both forcing one to adapt to new constraints or variability and opening up a limitless world of possibilities."
