    "bio": "Hey! I'm Kieran, a third year studying Microbial Biology and Aerospace Engineering :) I'm pursuing a career in Space Medicine, but I also generally love everything space. Experimenting in orbit and beyond allows us to study biology in a totally different domain, which can be invaluable for some of our current big questions. "
