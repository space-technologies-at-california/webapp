    "bio": "Hi! I'm in my second year of studying computer science and molecular and cell biology and have a passion for understanding the living world and engineering solutions for social good. I became interested in innovating in the space industry as it is not only necessary for advanced space exploration, but also allows us to rethink solutions to problems we face here on Earth."
