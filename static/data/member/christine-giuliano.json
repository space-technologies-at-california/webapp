    "bio": "I want (people) to live on Mars someday, but I also think that stretching the limits of science for space exploration has an extraordinary capacity for ameliorating human health. I would love to someday work on nanoscale enzyme prototypes, bioengineered food systems, or lightweight medical devices that help keep astronauts healthy but also give way to medical or ecological earth-based applications.
