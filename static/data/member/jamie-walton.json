  "bio": "Exploring space is about more than just discovering what's beyond the atmosphere-- it's the chance to understand how the universe works in ways we haven't even imagined yet, and hopefully take back some of that knowledge to change the way we think about science here on Earth. I am so excited to be working with STAC to push the boundaries of space technology and make incredible discoveries along the way."
