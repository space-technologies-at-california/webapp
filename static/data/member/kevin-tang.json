    "bio": "Learning about the development of the universe allows us to learn more about our own origins as living beings. Studying seemingly obscure topics such as cosmology or planetary and stellar sciences can help us learn more about why and how we came to be. STAC's mission to enable life beyond earth is yet another step to allow us to discover more about ourselves."
