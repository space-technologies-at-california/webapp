    "bio": "Space is the final frontier! A lack of interest in it doesn't even seem plausible to me. It's thrilling that there are so many answers out there waiting to be found; many questions to be asked. Space exploration and study could very well be necessary to lengthen the lifespan of the human race, which is by all measures a goal I am more than proud to work towards."
