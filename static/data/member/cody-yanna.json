    "bio": "Space is the final frontier! A lack of interest in it doesn't even seem plausible to me. It's thrilling that there are so many answers out there waiting to be found, along with many more questions that we don't know how to ask. Plus, space exploration and study could very well be necessary to lengthen the lifespan of the human race, which is by all measures a goal I am more than proud to work towards."
