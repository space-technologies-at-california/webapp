    "bio": "Hello, I'm a second-year EECS and Music student, focused on AI/ML and robotics. I believe that space is our future as a human species and that the exploration of space is the natural next step in continued progression of civilization; also, who wouldn't want to see Gargantua up close? Besides the latest developments in astronomy and technological development, I am also interested in sustainability, politics, classical music, and some other smaller interests."
