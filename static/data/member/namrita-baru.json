  "bio": "My passion for space began in 2nd grade with my admiration and respect for my female role model in STEM: Sally Ride, the first American woman in space. Space specifically fascinates me because there is so much research and science to develop to aid us in exploring and learning about what the universe has to offer. Exploring the unknown, and being able to do that with so many degrees of freedom, is why I'm interested in space."
