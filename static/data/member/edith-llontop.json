    "bio": "When exploring space, we have taken what we have known and pushed the boundaries for it even further. Our curiosity, our imagination drives us to constantly look for answers. Whether that be building new systems, working with new technologies, or even questioning what we previously thought was right,  gets us more intrigued to pursue these answers and go after the many things left to discover!"
