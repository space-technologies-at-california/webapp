  "bio": "Space provides a wealth of information that is intricately tied into the frontiers of research in almost every science. Only by further exploring this vast, largely unknown domain can mankind obtain the near infinite knowledge and resources necessary for our sustainable intellectual and technological growth. Also, funky stuff happens in space, and that's really cool."
