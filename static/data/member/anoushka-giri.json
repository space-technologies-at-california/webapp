    "bio": "Space is often looked at as where our future is heading, but I don't think many people realize how much of it is already a part of what we do. From the incredible span of NASA spinoffs to the new modes of industry it allows for, space is the motivation that has pushed us there. I know space technology will only continue to set off even meow chain reactions that go on to help everyone, and I hope to let our world appreciate and get involved with it more! "
