  "bio": "I think it’s humbling to know that if we work hard here on Earth, get our calculations right, and engineer tough enough technologies, we can take steps closer to even the furthest reaches of the universe. Space exploration provides opportunities to do things no one else has done before, and I’m excited to contribute towards this goal."
