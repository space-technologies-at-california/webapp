  "bio": "When I was younger, I had a terrifying, gut-wrenching fear of space. But as I learned more about its seemingly infinite possibilities, I grew to admire its formidability. Space technology is one of those fields that manages to make me feel like I know nothing about anything, and I love that. Space research is also not confined to everything beyond our planet, it presents boundless opportunities for life past our little blue marble as well as making life on Earth a little better."
