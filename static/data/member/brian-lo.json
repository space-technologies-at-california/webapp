  "bio": "After coming to UC Berkeley, I became very interested in aerospace through my engineering classes and certain aerospace clubs on campus. Space fascinates me because there is so much still unknown for us to explore and experiment. I am excited to take part in this exploration of space while expressing my creative freedom through STAC."
