  "bio": "'If people sat outside and looked at the stars each night, I'll bet they'd live a lot differently.' - Bill Watterson. I love this quote. This is how I feel when I remember we have so much to learn about our planet and space itself. I hope to help STAC as much as possible to push the frontier of space research and the space industry."
