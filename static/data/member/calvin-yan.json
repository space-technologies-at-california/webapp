  "bio": "Sometimes at night I stare up at the lightless void and my mind is consumed with the endless possibilities that await us in a world beyond our comprehension; the barriers we overcome to observe it, explore it, and maybe one day master it; the ceaseless endeavor upon which rests humanity's ambition, its curiosity, and perhaps its very survival as a species."
