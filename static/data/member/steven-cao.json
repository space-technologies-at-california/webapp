    "bio": "I took a seminar in modern physics in senior year of high school, and I loved learning about the frontiers of science. I think space is the most frontier-like of all the sciences: all of our current knowledge comes from an Earth-like environment, so space offers unlimited potential for discovery. I want to spend my entire life discovering new things, and that starts here at STAC!"
