    "bio": "I often feel overwhelmed by simultaneous feelings of existentialism and awe due to the vastness of space and the awareness of how insignificant humans are compared to the rest of the universe. Hopefully, exploring space will lead to discoveries that can answer my existential questions and broaden our understanding of the universe."
