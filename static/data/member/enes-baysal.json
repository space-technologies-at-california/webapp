    "bio": "I always thought how people may change their behaviors if they stood back and looked at earth's place in the universe. It is strange that not everyone will know or even try to find out the mysteries around them, and I seek to find a way to change that. My 4-month old brother, whom I named “Uzay” which means space in Turkish, has been my first volunteer that ignited the first spark of my goal."
