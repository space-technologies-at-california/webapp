  "bio": "Whether we are in San Francisco, Hong Kong, or Brisbane, when we look into space, it poses a challenge to all of us to explore its vast stretches. In this sense, space is unifying â€” its presence we all must confront. Through STAC, I have dedicated my time to seeing progress in meeting that universal challenge."
