    "bio": "When I was younger, space and space travel terrified me; even the experts knew so little about about it and that deeply worried me. As I grew older, I started to learn more about what we didn't know yet and my fear turned into curiosity. Now, the unknown quality of space is what fuels me to discover what it truly is and how humans will get there."
