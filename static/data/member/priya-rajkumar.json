    "bio": "David Tennant said that people assume space is a 'strict progression of cause to effect, but actually, from a nonlinear, non-subjective viewpoint, it's more like a big ball of wibbly-wobbly, timey-wimey... stuff.' The complexities of the cosmos will expand technology on earth, and as the universe expands, so should our developments in space exploration. I hope to help STAC push the frontier of space research."
