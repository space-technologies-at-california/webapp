    "bio": "It is my lifelong mission to test my own physical, intellectual, and philosophical boundaries. With increasing astronomical private and public investments beyond the volume of the 1960s Space Race, the space industry is the literal boundary where every push transcends the reaches of humanity. History made on the moon was not long ago, and history on Mars can and will be made very soon."
