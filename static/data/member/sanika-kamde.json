    "bio": "For me, space is my escape from reality. Itâ€™s a completely different environment from the one we live in and it has endless discoveries. Being able to create technology that brings us closer to the new worlds waiting to be discovered is quite extraordinary. Space exploration is only going to grow and will allow us to literally reach the stars. The stars are closer than ever."
