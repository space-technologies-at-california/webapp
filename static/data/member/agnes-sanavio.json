    "bio": "As Stephen Hawking said, 'I don't think the human race will survive the next thousand years, unless we spread into space.' Expanding space exploration and deepening our understanding of the universe, at large, is crucial for our survival. Space exploration is complex and vast, and I am ready to contribute to this urgent endeavor."
