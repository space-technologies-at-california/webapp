  "bio": "Space is about curiosity and wonderment, always looking over the next horizon of possibilities. To me, the expanse of space is also humbling to us as simple Earth bound humans. In the context of just our galaxy, we are but a small 'lonely speck in the great enveloping cosmic dark'. My hope is that space exploration one day brings unity to our world."
