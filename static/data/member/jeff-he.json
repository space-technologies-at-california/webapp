  "bio": "I have developed a love for space and astronomy ever since I read Stephen Hawking’s “The Universe in a Nutshell” at an age of 13. It simply is fascinating to take a break occasionally from matters on the ground, and focus on all the amazing physical processes at work above us. But how can we, as humans on earth, further explore this realm? STAC offers me the answer: through innovative technologies for space science. "
