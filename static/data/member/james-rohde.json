    "bio": "Iâ€™m a first-generation, low-income 3rd year undergraduate at UC Berkeley studying Integrative Biology and with an external interest in Astrobiology! I have a background in microgravity research as I was the Co-PI in an ISS experiment along with experience in biotechnology competitions sponsored by NASA. I am very interested in the developmental morphology of organisms in a variety of environments along with the intersection between astrobiology and the medical field as I hope to delve into the mysteries that are waiting to be uncovered.
