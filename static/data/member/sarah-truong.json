    "bio": "After watching Star Wars and Star Trek ritually when I was a young kid, my passion for space and astronomy grew. Encoded within me is an innate desire to determine the purpose of all things, including all components of human life and the universe. This drives me to help STAC accomplish its mission today in hopes that we can add further value to the study of the final frontier. "
