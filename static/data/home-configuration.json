		"description": "Our innovation in space technologies is a multi-campus and industry-wide effort. We have set up a space program at Berkeley to test space experiments at a low cost. We utilize a high-quality network of university partners and industry advisors to push the technology in the space community through high-impact research. STAC provides a platform for these groups and advisors to collaborate and make strides in far reaching technology that is also connected to major problems in the space industry today."

Some one has to work on small incremental steps that get us one step closer to these long term goals: that is exactly what STAC is trying to do. We work on projects that get humanity one step closer to long term space innovations."
