Current partners include UC Santa Barbara (PCBSat development), and UC Berkeley Space Science Laboratory (vibration and vacuum testing), and NASA Ames (rover design). STAC provides a platform for these groups to collaborate and make strides in far reaching technology that is also connected to major problems in the space industry today."

Some one has to work on small incremental steps that get us one step closer to these long term goals: that is what STAC is trying to do. We work on a project that get humanity one step closer to a long term goal."
