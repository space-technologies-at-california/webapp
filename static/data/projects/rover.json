		"A resource rover is an extraterrestrial vehicle used for space exploration as well as resource extraction on various celestial bodies.",
		"Currently, several companies and research groups are focusing on developing rovers to explore the surface of Mars to verify that it is sustainable for humans. However, STAC, in partnership with NASA Ames, hopes to build an autonomous resource rover that enables commercial flights and bases on the Moon.",
		"Humans are currently unable to access most of the moon’s extensive resources. There is an abundance of water trapped in the Moon’s ice caps, vast areas of titanium hidden underground, and various volatiles scattered all across the Moon’s surface. With the help of a resource rover that is fully controllable and autonomous, STAC will attempt to extract these resources and return them to Earth for our utilization.",
		"Moreover, research has shown that extracting water can even lead to the generation of fuel by splitting its hydrogen and oxygen atoms. Because these rovers will have autonomous capabilities, they will be extremely easy to maintain and multiply. The end goal is to implement an array of these rovers that all work together to build their own community on the Moon. Once the rovers become powerful and skilled enough, they will be able to use the resources that they extract to aid humans in space exploration."
