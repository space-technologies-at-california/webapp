  "bio": "I have diverse interests from space exploration to organic chemistry. I spend much of my time at the UC Berkeley Radio Astronomy Lab working on the HYPERION project probing signals from the Epoch of Reionization. I also enjoy competitive ballroom dance and cooking - perhaps the only thing more vast than the cosmos is the myriad of slow cooker recipes the internet has to offer."
