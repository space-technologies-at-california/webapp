    "bio": "Thirty years ago, the voyager spacecraft took its last peek at the earth. In its eye, the earth appeared as a tiny dot, so negligible against the vast universe. The image evokes an awe-inspiring sensation in many of its viewers including me. Comparing to the grandeur of the universe, the earth inevitably loses its lust: the violent history it went through is not so significant; the various dwellers it incubates may not be so unique. Living deep inside the society, we constantly accept our environment as the totality of our universe, failing to recognize the existence of a much wider one filled with highly-energetic particles traveling close to the speed of light, humongous stars clusters spanning across hundreds of lightyears, and exploding stars outshining a whole galaxy. Therefore, driven by the simplest and purest motivation, curiosity, I let go of my imagination to be carried by the wonders of the universe."
