  "bio": "I am so naturally curious about the wonders of the night sky: the stars, the moon, and the planets. I always ponder if the resources from these bodies can help humanity extend beyond a single planet.  Technology is the only vehicle to drive the progress of space exploration forward and further broaden our understanding of the mysteries of the universe. I am excited to work with a motivated team to innovate groundbreaking technologies that will be the frontiers in space exploration."
