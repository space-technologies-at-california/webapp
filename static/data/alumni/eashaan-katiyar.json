    "bio": "Generations of humans have looked up at the stars and wondered what was out there, pulling grandiose stories out of the unknown to turn stars into fierce animals and demigods. I'm lucky to exist at a time where humanity has rapidly advanced space exploration, and I hope to advance space-related technology in my lifetime."
