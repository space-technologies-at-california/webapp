    "Tess is an investor in Bessemer Venture Partners Menlo Park office. She is focused on frontier tech, specifically commercial space, machine/deep/reinforcement learning, blockchain, and quantum computing. She currently serves as board observer for Rocket Lab, Spire, Auth0, Endgame, Distil Networks, Team8, Virtru, Claroty, CyberGRX, and Illusive Networks.",
    "She holds a bachelor's degree in aerospace engineering from the University of Michigan (go blue!) and a master's degree in aeronautics and astronautics engineering from Stanford (go trees!). She was a mission manager at SpaceX where she worked with the government on integrating their payloads with the Falcon9 rocket. She also worked at Fictiv, a startup using 3D printing and CNC machining to democratize access to manufacturing.",
    "Tess writes a space comic, Ada Ride, which you should check out for a good laugh. Don't be surprised if Tess asks you to go on a hike or walk rather than a typical coffee meeting--being a SoCal native she loves the sun."
