However, STAC, in partnership with NASA Ames, hopes to build an autonomous resource rover that enables commercial flights and bases on the Moon.",
        "Humans are currently unable to access most of the moon\u2019s extensive resources. There is an abundance of water trapped in the Moon\u2019s ice caps, vast areas of titanium hidden underground, and various volatiles scattered all across the Moon\u2019s surface. With the help of a resource rover that is fully controllable and autonomous, STAC will attempt to extract these resources and return them to Earth for our utilization.",
        "Moreover, research has shown that extracting water can even lead to the generation of fuel by splitting its hydrogen and oxygen atoms. Because these rovers will have autonomous capabilities, they will be extremely easy to maintain and multiply. The end goal is to implement an array of these rovers that all work together to build their own community on the Moon. Once the rovers become powerful and skilled enough, they will be able to use the resources that they extract to aid humans in space exploration."

        "Each biosphere unit will be maintained by a smart-control software that receives feedback from multiple sensors to ensure environmental equilibrium. Mechanical and chemical integrations will ensure detection of humidity, pH, chemical species, temperature and other environmental state variables. A controlled feedback system ensures that an individual does not need to manually monitor the biosphere.",

With constraints for energy and resource supplies in extraterrestrial environments, the biosphere should be self-sustaining. Some potential avenues for this development include environmental power harvesting, in-situ resource harvesting, and waste recycling."

While there are a variety of space applications for high altitude balloons, the current project will focus on the long term goal of creating a reliable high altitude balloon for future STAC experiments. This way, observations can be made above the Earth\u2019s atmosphere for a low cost.",
        "We will launch three high-altitude balloons by May 2018. The first balloon will be equipped with a camera and electronic sensors to test the efficacy of our system and then two subsequent balloons will be launched with various research experiments, crowdsourced from the Berkeley campus community. This will form the foundation of a long lasting STAC HAB program with launches for years to come. HAB payloads (aerospace cargo) will help detail how a near space environment affects lifeforms, optics, and physical mechanics. Once the ability to do this is successfully is ensured, then we plan to launch a telescope payload to show that it is possible to put telescopes above Earth\u2019s atmosphere for a low cost method of performing cosmology.
