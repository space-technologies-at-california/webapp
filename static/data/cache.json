We are not a typical engineering club that focuses on a set competition but rather we focus on making strides in innovating space technologies.\nWe are currently pursuing this goal by working to enable life beyond our Earth. With projects ranging from a 3U CubeSat Deployer of smaller PCBSats, launching Microgravity Experiments with a wide variety of research experiments inside, a High Altitude Balloon program, a BioSphere project to work on implications of life off earth, and even an Autonomous Resource Rover to explore rover designs, make it ISRU capable and autonomous.\nOur innovation in space technologies is a multi-campus and industry-wide effort. Current partners include UC Santa Barbara (PCBSat development), and UC Berkeley Space Science Laboratory (vibration and vacuum testing), and NASA Ames (rover design). STAC provides a platform for these groups to collaborate and make strides in far reaching technology that is also connected to major problems in the space industry today.",

For the past two years, STAC\u2019s High Altitude Balloon (HAB) program has melded custom hardware with off-the-shelf parts to lift payloads to 100,000 feet\u2014all at less than $2000 per launch.  Such an altitude is perfect for certain astrobiology and atmospheric experiments; STAC has launched payloads for the NASA Ames Research Center and for Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.",

The second iteration of The Interstellar Microgravity Experiment (TIME II) aims to characterize these effects.  The TIME II payload will experience two minutes of microgravity on a suborbital Blue Origin flight, during which it will expose a series of microfluidic E. coli cultures to the antibiotic gentamicin.  Through detailed laboratory analysis of the E. coli\u2019s RNA expression, we will determine the impact of microgravity on antibiotic efficacy, thereby gaining valuable insight towards keeping astronauts healthy.",

If successfully demonstrated in low Earth orbit, the gyroscope\u2014which is orders of magnitude smaller and more accurate than traditional mechanical alternatives\u2014has the potential to revolutionalize sensor technology for CubeSats, WaferSat constellations, and the other microsatellites of the NewSpace era.",
