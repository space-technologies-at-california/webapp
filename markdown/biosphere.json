    "Potential applications include agriculture processing for food, biofuels, and other chemical production to supply astronauts and space colonies with these necessities. This project opens a new dimension of production in space beyond status quo mechanical and electrical systems and functions as a gateway to the colonization of space.",

    "Each biosphere unit will be maintained by a smart-control software that receives feedback from multiple sensors to ensure environmental equilibrium. Mechanical and chemical integrations will ensure detection of humidity, pH, chemical species, temperature and other environmental state variables. A controlled feedback system ensures that an individual does not need to manually monitor the biosphere.",

    "Another primary consideration for the biosphere is its efficiency. With constraints for energy and resource supplies in extraterrestrial environments, the biosphere should be self-sustaining. Some potential avenues for this development include environmental power harvesting, in-situ resource harvesting, and waste recycling."
